                        After the branches are removed, the main trunk of the tree is cut down in sections, starting from the top and working downward. This technique, known as "sectional felling," allows for controlled removal of the tree while minimizing the risk of injury or property damage.
                        
                        Once the tree is cut down, the remaining stump may be ground down or removed entirely, depending on the preferences of the property owner. Stump grinding is often preferred as it eliminates tripping hazards and allows for easier landscaping in the future.
                        
                        Finally, the debris from the tree removal process is typically cleared away, either through hauling it offsite or through mulching and recycling. Proper disposal of tree debris is important for maintaining the cleanliness and aesthetics of the property.
                        
                        Overall, tree removal is a complex process that requires careful planning, specialized equipment, and skilled execution to ensure safety and minimize environmental impact. Hiring a professional tree removal service is often the best option for ensuring the job is done correctly and efficiently.</p>
